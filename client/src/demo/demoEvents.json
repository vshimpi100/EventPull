    "title": "LIL PUMP & LIL SKIES AT COCA-COLA ROXY",
    "price": 41,
    "description": "Rapper Lil Pump was born Gazzy Garcia in Miami, Florida in 2000. Though Garcia had little interest in making music growing up, he took to writing raps and making his own tracks after he was expelled from school in the ninth grade for fighting with another student. Already friends with Smokepurpp at this time, he began collaborating with the rapper/producer and releasing tracks online starting in 2016, the songs marked by a repetitive, reckless style. The response was overwhelming, with tracks collecting millions of plays in a relatively short time frame. Lil Pump's celebrity grew with each song, as singles like Broke My Wrist, D Rose, and Elementary expanded his catalog and fame. Videos, touring, and an enormously popular social media presence all followed, based on the strength of just a few online tracks. Various labels expressed interest, but within the first year of his life as a rapper, he hadn't even released a mixtape, let alone a proper full-length. Pump's big breakthrough arrived in 2017 with the explosion of his single, Gucci Gang, which rose to the Top Three of the Hot 100 by the end of the year. He issued his debut mixtape, Lil Pump, in October, featuring appearances by Smokepurpp, Gucci Mane, Lil Yachty, and more. The effort hit number three on the Billboard 200 and rose to number two on the R&B/hip-hop chart. ~ Fred Thomas",
